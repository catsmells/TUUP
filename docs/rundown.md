## Introduction

Consider this file a more comprehensive approach to a traditional FAQ.

TUUP (_The Untitled Utility Project_) is a blockchain protocol with the idea of a truly decentralized clearing house in mind. Absolute privacy, security, and freedom are kept in mind with everything
that TUUP is. It is blockchain & network independent, allowing all customization & tinkering to take place on the frontend. Non-fungible tokens (_NFTs_) are the heart of TUUP. No sole entity controls
TUUP, and the data lasts forever - even if the protocol ceases to exist.

## The Layers of TUUP

There are four "major" TUUP layers:

- Layer 0: The Concept.
- Layer 1: The Protocol.
- Layer 2: The Network.
- Layer 3: The Application.

Within these major layers are sub-layers that aid in defining more specific functionality & operations of TUUP.

- Layer 0: The Concept.
  - Layer α: The Community.
  - Layer β: Community Governance.
- Layer 1: The Protocol.
- Layer 2: The Network.
  - Layer 2.1: The Transaction (_TX_) Controller.
  - Layer 2.2: The Storage (_STO_) Controller.
  - Layer 2.3: Independent Node Management (_TUUPWAN_).
- Layer 3: The Application.
  - Layer 3.1: Global Governance.

## Protocol & Network Independence

TUUP is completely independent of particular protocols & networks. In order to utilize the TUUP protocol at its minimum, two sub-layers must be addressed - Transaction & Storage. While TUUP may be
capable of both in future versions, it currently requires a network/protocol independent of itself to facilitate transactions, with another to facilitate storage. Both the TX & STO technologies _must_
adhere to the TUUP protocol.

In the event of catostrophic protocol/network failure, the data stored should be accessible via pen & paper - preferably as easy as possible.

## The Concepts of True Decentralization & True Permastorage

In the state of the Internet (or Web2 for that matter), several issues come to mind:

- Mass censorship.
- Enforced/encouraged censorship.
- Country-centric groupthink enforcement (_not nationalism_).
- Idealogies conditioned to the networks & platforms at hand.
- Interference by parties outside the development or community of a given protocol, network, or application.
- Enforced backdoors.
- Clandestine backdoors.
- Poor security/privacy in the name of so-called "safety".
- Lack of custody of one's own data.
- Being forced to agree to a terms-of-service per an employing agency (_such as requiring a Microsoft account to interact with employees_).
- False encryption methods.
- Lack of absolute neutrality.
- Contradictory practices in order to appeal to a grand or external party.

With the breakthrough & advancements of blockchain technology, we are able to address and solve some of the issues above. While the issues may still exist in a voluntary setting, the ability to
proactively evade them is more available than ever imagined. As our current state of technology stands, the only instances of experiencing the issues above would boil down to the community surrounding
a Web3 solution to a Web2 problem; usually more of an evolution than a solution. Unfortunately, complications _do_ arise with blockchain technology in the face of the mentioned:

- A sect of actors using a lack of regulation and/or public understanding of blockchain technology to get-rich-quick.
- Ignorance of the actual breakthroughs that blockchain, Web3, and NFTs/SFTs bring (_I'm looking at you, Bored Apes!_).
- Eventual centralization in a more obfuscated format.
- Coordinated hijackings of DAO leadership.
- Lack of creativity in the name of unlikely profit (_overuse of pre-existing libraries_).
- Over-centralization/authoritarianism (unwanted/useless KYC).
- Overlooking the global uselessness of identification.
- Continued reliance on Web2.

We can actually solve these issues, but it hasn't truly been accomplished. Here is what TUUP proposes:

- Data is stored permanently, forever.
- Stored data _cannot_ be deleted, even by external/third parties.
- Data shown on the frontend _can_ be obfuscated on the frontend, but can be recovered by anyone from the blockchain itself.
- Frontends are technology-agnostic; they can be made with anything, and are in control by the user/community that made it.
- TUUP is a gasless protocol. The only possible occurence of gas fees is with the minting of NFTs, and depositing/withdrawing the token - neither of which are the fault of the protocol itself.
- TUUP is a utilitarian protocol with infinite tokens, where value is derived from frontend development (_Layer 3_).
- Data can be retrieved with pen & paper if need be.
- No usernames, messages, transactions, or data on the protocol can be quarantined or blocked.
- No entity can limit content or activity of any kind on TUUP, but frontends may enforce their own rules so long as they adhere to the core mechanics of TUUP.
- Due to the nature of true decentralization via TUUP, no entity can cripple the system in any meaningful way.
- TUUP is chain & network-neutral, without the need of a backend of any kind.

There are two conceptual double-edged swords at play here, and _must_ be understood from an absolutely-neutral standpoint if one wishes to understand TUUP as a whole:

- TUUP allows for true end-to-end encryption. Interference by outside parties _cannot_ occur.
- TUUP allows for true permanent data storage, forever.

**Let's address the first sword:**

Any technology that claims to encrypt the communication between parties cannot interfere with the activity within the realm of claimed encryption. Backdoors put in by the developing party, or
by an external entity prove this to no longer be truly secure; backdoors created by such entities can (and will) be utilized by bad actors.

The following technologies utilize these methods of false encryption:

- WhatsApp
- WeChat
- Signal
- Telegram
- Keybase
- iMessage
- Skype

**Now the second sword:**

Blockchain technology in its current definition _should_ be absolutely permanent by default. However, certain entities developing within the space of Web3 can take down communities/applications without
notice, and may obfuscate any proof of this with a closed scheme. This is not a libre way of doing things, and can lead to censorship to a worse degree than Web2 - especially with advanced KYC technology.

A fantastic example would be Arweave.

## The Applications for Permastorage

There are many real-world applications for permastorage:

- True archives, with a smaller resource footprint.
- Covert journalism.
- National identification systems.
- Media albums.
- Geneology mapping.
- Record-keeping services.
