## Introduction

Congrats for looking into TUUP for whatever reason - contributing, using, or maybe you're here to protest against it. Anyhow, I figure these are the basic guidelines for things.

## The Twelve Commandments

1. This is not a Terms-of-Service.
2. This is not a Code of Conduct.
3. If you create your private network outside of the TUUP community, you forfeit community support and updates.
4. Protocol updates are different from network updates; you may choose your version.
5. TUUP will forever be non-KYC. If your network enforces KYC policies, you are not using the TUUP protocol.
6. Users may choose to identify themselves, but that is not enforced by TUUP.
7. TUUP code is _not_ to be scraped/crawled for the use of training AI/ML tech/NN of any kind, for any reason.
8. It is recommended to define any found use cases in the dedicated "Use Cases" file. You'll advance TUUP!
9. No contribution is too insignificant!
10. All users/contributors are welcome!
11. The concept of absolute permastorage should not be a frightening concept; one can achieve the TUUP Trinity with it!
12. Infrastructure trumps hype.

## The Trinity of TUUP

## Code Contribution

All submitted code must follow the following guidelines:

- Nothing intentionally malicious.
- No unnecessary whitespace.
- No useless comments.

Submitted code will be subject to community review before incorporation (also up to the community).

Contributors who achieve outstanding things within the community & codebase (programming, design, security, etc.) will receive public recognition!
