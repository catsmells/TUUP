# Philosophy of TUUP

While TUUP can - in no way - be an _absolute_ solution to the problems of computing today, the basic philosophy should be considered as an advancement in addressing certain issues. This
doesn't _have_ to be considered - even when developing upon TUUP; it's a mere suggestion to the thought behind TUUP. Maybe in the future, other hackers will take elements from here to use
in future projects.

## The Faults of Modern Computing.

#### Making Things Complicated for the Sake of Being Unique.

While a point may be made in developing brand-new languages specfic to projects to increase the efficiency points for specific tasks, it often times is the end result of the laziest of programmers. This
shouldn't be confused with making things more efficient with new toolsets to avoid work; projects that offer project-specific languages often make worse the other aspects of a language (inherent security,
support, community, etc.) for the sake of a slight efficiency improvement. This is often to avoid using a legacy language that can do it anyhow, but the founding team of a project hates using out of complexity -
despite the language doing the perceived task much better in every aspect. It's like re-inventing the wheel, but forsaking the wheel entirely for the sake of a system that hovers an inch above the ground, powered
only by proprietary fuel cells that destroy the Earth even more than Li-On batteries. Pretty cool and unique, right?

#### Projects Today are Built on Existing Flawed Systems, Therefore Can Never Be a True Solution to a Problem.

Lengthy title, concise point.
